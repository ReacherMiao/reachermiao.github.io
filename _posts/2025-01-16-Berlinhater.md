## Berlinhater, what is it?
This is a website: [Berlinhater](https://www.berlinhater.com).
I discovered this stuff in 2021, while researching my chances of studying in Germany. This helped me to make up my mind to study in Berlin. On the description it says:
>Why Berlin Hater? 
>Anybody who's been in berlin long enough will know why.  Berlin is a cold, remote oasis of everything that is wrong with this world.
>But is that reason enough to make a whole webpage about it?
>Berlin is stuffed full of naive tourists, and life's losers, who will preach for hours about how wonderful this grey, lifeless city is. We wanted to create a place where people can spread their true opinions and realize they're not alone as 'Berlin Haters'  So please... Motz Mit because even in a city of 3.5 million a*^holes, it sucks to feel alone. 

## My thoughts on it
I thought that in eastern philosophy, how much one suffers determines how successful he could potentially be. I decided to ultilize Berlin as a place to train myself thorough the suffering. 

This blog is also very useful to learn about Berlin in different perspectives.

## Moving to Berlin
March 2021 I left China and moved to Berlin. I came with tent and winter sleeping bag, since I was not able to find a place to stay until I came. I was prepared to sleep on the street for a couple of days until I can find a place. In the end I was welcomed warmly by a doctor friend of my german friend Michael Haese, which I stayed for the next 15 months.
