# First Post on my blog

After a minial research, I decided to host my blog with chripy theme. 

## Why blogging?

I believe it is never too late to start blogging, as words can carry more over time than a lot of other mediums.

### What do I blog

I write thoughts, life experiences and observations. 

### Who am I

I am from China, a student who lives currently in Berlin and tries to finish his study of BSc EE at Technical University of Berlin.

## Conclusion

This is the frist try of the blog, would be happy to see that it can work with just one try.
